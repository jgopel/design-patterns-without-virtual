## Singleton

The canonical implementation of the singleton pattern does not use `virtual` at
all. Additionally, this pattern is now widely considered an anti-pattern, and as
such should not be used. The reasoning behind this is both well documented
elsewhere and beyond the scope of this project. As such, there is no
implementation of the singleton pattern required in this repo.
